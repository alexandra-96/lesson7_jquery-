Extra Credit text
 The features I added to enhance my Recipe Display Application were the DOM traversal in the title, 
 in order to make sure the audience knows exactly what they are viewing. I also added a css that makes
 the subtitles red and gold, similair to the colors of my wonderful university, Florida State University. 
 The animation I included was almost exactly the same as the one in the assignment but I have modified it
 to work faster, for the anxious people like me who cannot wait the extra second it takes to show information.
